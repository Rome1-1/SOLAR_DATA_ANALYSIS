5. Insights and Recommendations
5.1 High-Potential Regions
Regions with consistently high GHI and DNI values should be prioritized for solar installations. Moderate temperature and humidity levels enhance solar panel efficiency.
5.2 Sensor Maintenance
Regular cleaning and maintenance of sensors significantly improve the accuracy of readings and should be an operational priority.
5.3 Synergy Between Wind and Solar Systems
Wind metrics showed negligible correlation with solar radiation, allowing independent operation of wind and solar energy systems without interference.
