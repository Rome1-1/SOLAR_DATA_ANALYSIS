Insights and Recommendations
1 High-Potential Regions
Regions with consistently high GHI and DNI values should be prioritized for solar installations. Moderate temperature and humidity levels enhance solar panel efficiency.
2 Sensor Maintenance
Regular cleaning and maintenance of sensors significantly improve the accuracy of readings and should be an operational priority.
3 Synergy Between Wind and Solar Systems
Wind metrics showed negligible correlation with solar radiation, allowing independent operation of wind and solar energy systems without interference.
